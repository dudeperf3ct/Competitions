# Problem Statement
In this challenge, we try to predict the electricity usage of heating and cooling appliances in a household based on internal and external temperatures and other weather conditions. Each observation measures electricity in a 10-minute interval. The temperatures and humidity have been averaged for 10-minute intervals.

Use the observations in the train dataset to train your model and predict the energy used in the test dataset.
