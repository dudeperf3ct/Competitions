# MCQ

1. Let X and Y be two random variables. If X and Y are independent, then they are uncorrelated.

=> True / False

2. Let X and Y be two random variables. If X and Y are uncorrelated, then they are independent.

=> True / False

3. Suppose that you are building a linear regression model for a given dataset. Let n be the number of observations in the data set and p be the number of variables. If n is much larger than p, then the least squares estimate tends to have low variance and therefore will perform well on test observations.

=> True / False

4. Let n and p be defined as in question 3. If p > n, then the least squares method will perform very well in practice.

=> True / False

5. Suppose that there are two endangered species of polar bear. The only difference between the species is in the probability of giving birth to twins. Species X gives birth to twins 10% of the time, otherwise giving birth to a single cub. Species Y gives birth to twins 20% of the time, otherwise giving birth to a single cub. Suppose that you are working for a captive breeding program. You have a new female bear of unknown species. She just gave birth to twins. What is the probability that her next birth will also be twins?

=> (i)1/5&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii)1/6&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)1/7&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iv)1/8&nbsp;&nbsp;

You have built a logistic regression model. In your model, a coefficient has value 1.6. This means that each unit change in the corresponding predictor variable multiples the odds of the outcome by

=> (i)2.75&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii)3.95&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)4.75&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iv)4.95&nbsp;&nbsp;


# Make My Trip Problem Statement

Given dataset contains a total of 17 columns labeled A-P, out of which A-O columns are the features and column P is the label. Column “id” specifies a unique number for every row.

Your job is to build a machine learning model to predict column P using all or some of the feature columns.

The submission should be a csv file stating id along with the predicted label.

Please check sample_submissions.csv file and make sure that your submission file in exact same format.

Files Provided in Dataset -

Following are the files that will be provided in the dataset -

  `Train.csv`  - This file contains all the above mentioned columns. You are expected to train your models on this file.

  `Test.csv`  - This file contains all the above mentioned columns except “P” column. You have to predict this column for each records given in this file.

  `Sample_submission.csv`  - This file consists of sample submissions. Your submission should be in exact same format.
